* Trope-Mode

A major mode for writing the unnamed markup language used for the
website [[https://tvtropes.org/][TV Tropes]], which should be put in
".trp" or ".trope" files. This package aims to be fast, use as little dependencies
as possible, and to make it easier to write pages for the website, not
to use as a standalone markup format.

** Installation

This package is now available in the MELPA repository. To
access it, make sure to add MELPA to your package sources (some
package managers such as elpaca have it by default). Then, use ~M-x
package-install~ and then the package name or use the following
declaration in your ~init.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (use-package trope-mode :ensure t :defer t)

#+END_SRC

And the trope should be available on the next restart for properly
named files or with ~M-x trope-mode~.

If you do not want to install it using a package manager, you can also
use the package by getting the source code directly. To use this
package, clone the project using git to a directory of your
choice. Then, in your ~init.el~ file add this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/trope-mode")
    (require 'trope-mode)

#+END_SRC

The path should be to the project folder, not the file
~trope-mode.el~.

** Functions

Besides font-locking, this package also provides functions and
keybindings to speed up writing.

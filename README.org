* Trope-Mode

A major mode for writing the unnamed markup language used for the
website [[https://tvtropes.org/][TV Tropes]], which should be put in
".trp" files. This package aims to be fast, use as little dependencies
as possible, and to make it easier to write pages for the website, not
to use as a standalone markup format.

** Installation

Currently, this package is not in any centralized repository, although
that is a goal for the project. To use this package, clone the project
using git to a directory of your choice. Then, in your ~init.el~ file
add this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

 (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/trope-mode")
 (require 'trope-mode)

#+END_SRC

The path should be to the project folder, not the file ~trope-mode.el~.

** Functions

Besides font-locking, this package also provides functions and
keybindings to speed up writing.
